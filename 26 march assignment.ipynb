    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the model. Let's discuss the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This assumption implies that the coefficients of the independent variables remain constant across different levels of the variables. It can be checked by visualizing scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable and assessing if the points roughly follow a linear pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This assumption assumes that there is no correlation or dependence between the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) of the regression model. It can be examined using techniques such as autocorrelation plots or Durbin-Watson tests to detect any significant correlation in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread or dispersion of the residuals should be consistent. Homoscedasticity can be assessed by plotting the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables. If there is a clear pattern or a cone-like shape in the plot, indicating changing variance, it suggests violation of homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals follow a normal distribution. This assumption assumes that the errors of the regression model are normally distributed. It can be checked by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and comparing them to a normal distribution. Deviations from normality can indicate issues such as outliers or skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: The independent variables in the model are not highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to instability in the coefficient estimates and make it challenging to determine the individual effects of the independent variables. Multicollinearity can be examined using correlation matrices or variance inflation factor (VIF) calculations. A high correlation between independent variables (typically above 0.7 or 0.8) suggests multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable to assess linearity.\n",

    "2. Plot the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables to assess homoscedasticity.\n",
