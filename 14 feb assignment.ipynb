    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "race condition :\n",
    "In Python, a race condition occurs when two or more threads or processes try to access and modify \n",
    "a shared resource simultaneously, and the outcome of the operations depends on the order in which\n",
    "they are executed. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as data corruption or inconsistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have two threads that both try to increment a variable by one.\n",
    "If they access and modify the variable at the same time, the value of the variable may not\n",
    "be incremented by two as expected, but only by one, because each thread will overwrite the other's modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid race conditions in Python, you can use synchronization mechanisms such as locks,\n",
    "semaphores, and barriers to ensure that only one thread or process can access the shared resource at a time.\n",
    "Another approach is to use atomic operations, which are guaranteed to execute as a single, indivisible operation,\n",
    "and thus prevent interference from other threads or processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "deadlock :\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock is a situation that can occur in a concurrent program when two or more threads or processes are \n",
    "blocked and waiting for each other to release a resource or finish an operation, resulting in a situation \n",
    "where none of them can proceed. In other words, a deadlock occurs when two or more threads are stuck in a \n",
    "loop, waiting for each other to release a resource that they are holding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have two threads, A and B, each of which needs to acquire two resources, X and Y, \n",
    "to complete their respective tasks. If thread A acquires resource X and thread B acquires resource Y, and then\n",
    "both threads try to acquire the other resource that is being held by the other thread, a deadlock can occur.\n",
    "Neither thread can proceed until the other thread releases the resource, but neither thread will release the \n",
    "resource until it has acquired the other resource, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve because they can occur unpredictably and may not always be \n",
    "reproducible. To prevent deadlocks in concurrent programs, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms \n",
    "such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables correctly, and to avoid circular dependencies among resources.\n",
