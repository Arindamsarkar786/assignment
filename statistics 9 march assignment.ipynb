    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with\n",
    "an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :Both Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable. However, they are used for different types of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a finite or countably infinite set of values. It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a specific value. Mathematically, the PMF of a discrete random variable X is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = x) = f(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where f(x) is the probability that X takes on the value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case of rolling a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The probability of each outcome is 1/6, so the PMF of the random variable X (the outcome of a single roll) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = P(X = 2) = P(X = 3) = P(X = 4) = P(X = 5) = P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a given interval. It gives the probability that a random variable falls within a specific interval. Mathematically, the PDF of a continuous random variable X is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = dF(x)/dx\n",
    "\n",
    "Where F(x) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of X, which gives the probability that X is less than or equal to a specific value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case of the height of a randomly selected person from a population. The height can take on any value within a certain range, and it is a continuous random variable. The PDF of this random variable might be a bell-shaped curve (i.e., a normal distribution). In this case, the PDF gives the probability that a person's height falls within a specific interval, such as between 160 cm and 170 cm. The height values that are more likely to be observed (i.e., have a higher probability density) will have a higher point on the PDF curve."

    "Ans :Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a specific value x. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n",

    "F(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF can be used to determine the probability of a range of values of X by subtracting the CDF value at the lower bound from the CDF value at the upper bound. For example, the probability that X falls between two values a and b is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The CDF is a useful tool in probability and statistics because it provides a complete picture of the probability distribution of a random variable. By knowing the CDF, we can determine the probability of any range of values of X. The CDF can also be used to calculate the percentiles of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case of rolling a fair six-sided die. The CDF of the random variable X (the outcome of a single roll) is:\n",

    "= 5/6 for 5 ≤ x < 6\n",
    "= 1 for x ≥ 6\n",

    "The CDF tells us, for example, that the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 4 is 2/3. We can also use the CDF to calculate the probability of rolling a number between 2 and 5, which is:\n",

Additionally, it allows us to easily compare the probability distribution of different random variables or different distributions."

    "Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :The normal distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics and plays a significant role in many fields, including science, engineering, finance, and social sciences. Some of the reasons for its importance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Approximation: Many naturally occurring phenomena can be approximated by the normal distribution. For example, the heights and weights of individuals in a large population, the scores on a standardized test, or the amount of rainfall in a region over a given period of time can be approximated by the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inference: The normal distribution is used in statistical inference to test hypotheses and estimate population parameters. In many situations, the assumption of normality is necessary for statistical inference to be valid.\n",

    "3. Central Limit Theorem: The central limit theorem states that the sum or mean of a large number of independent random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of the individual variables. This theorem is used in many areas of statistics and enables us to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples.\n",

    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli\n",
    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the outcomes of a single Bernoulli trial, which is an experiment with two possible outcomes: success and failure. The distribution is characterized by a parameter p, which represents the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the Bernoulli distribution is flipping a coin. If we consider \"heads\" to be a success and \"tails\" to be a failure, then the probability of success (p) is 0.5, and the probability of failure (1-p) is also 0.5. Thus, the Bernoulli distribution models the probability of getting \"heads\" on a single coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution models the probability of a single success or failure, while the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider flipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of times \"heads\" appears. This can be modeled using the binomial distribution with parameters n=10 (the number of trials) and p=0.5 (the probability of success on each trial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Bernoulli distribution models the probability of a single success or failure, while the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. The binomial distribution can be seen as the sum of n independent Bernoulli trials, where n is a fixed number."

The theorem is applicable to a wide range of statistical tests and helps to explain why normal distribution arises so frequently in the natural world.\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem states that, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population, the sampling distribution of the means will tend towards a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

The following are the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",

    "1. Independence: The sample observations must be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one observation should not depend on the value of another observation.\n",
