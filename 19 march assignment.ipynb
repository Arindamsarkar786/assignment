    "Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to scale numeric features to a specific range. It transforms the data so that it falls within a predetermined interval, typically between 0 and 1.\n",

    "The formula for Min-Max scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",

    "The Min-Max scaling technique is commonly used when the absolute values of the features are not as important as their relative relationships and when the features have different scales. It ensures that all features contribute proportionally to the analysis, preventing dominant features from overshadowing others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a dataset of house prices with two features: 'area' (measured in square meters) and 'price' (measured in thousands of dollars). The 'area' feature ranges from 100 to 500, and the 'price' feature ranges from 200 to 800.\n",

    "It's worth noting that Min-Max scaling assumes a linear relationship between the features and may not be suitable if there are outliers in the data. In such cases, other scaling techniques, such as standardization (Z-score normalization), may be more appropriate."
